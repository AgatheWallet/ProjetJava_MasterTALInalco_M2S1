I #couldn't get used to sleeping# well in my new flat with all the noise from cars on the road. 
We #would# go to the swimming pool on Sundays, maybe we'll go again !
David was severely #chided# because that was an expensive car.
He #is not used to# most of the software but he has a good  knowledge of English. 
When I was young, I #used to# eat a lot of chocolate
The body of the car was totally #stove in# by the crash.
I'll keep #asking# her about what she did!
I #want to# drink a huge coffee!
